// Challenge: LIFE IN WEEKS CODING EXERCISE
// I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realized just how little time we actually have.
//In this challenge, you are going to create a function
//that tells us how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
//It will take your current age as the input and console.logs a message with our time left in this format:
//You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
//Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
//For this challenge, assume there are 365 days in a year,
//52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
//IMPORTANT your console.log output should match the
//Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.
//Example Input
//e.g. If you are 56 years old:
//lifeInWeeks(56)
// Example Output
// You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
